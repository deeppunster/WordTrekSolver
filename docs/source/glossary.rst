    .. _animal:
    animal
        The puzzles are grouped by an animal name.

    _`puzzle`
        A square containing letters.  The letters are from several words in the
        puzzle.  Solving the puzzle requires finding all the `answer`_\ s
        in the puzzle - which consumes all the letters contained in
        the square.

    _`answer`
        This consists of two or more letters in adjacent squares in the
        puzzle_.  Adjacent in this case means up, down, left, right, or any
        diagonal (essentially the eight points of a compass).  Usually - but
        not always - these answers can be found in an unabridged dictionary.

    _`Word Trek`
        A puzzle game available for IOS and (perhaps) for Androids.

    _`PyCharm`
        A Python IDE to manage all aspects of a Python project.  PyCharm is
        available from `JetBrains <http://www.jetbrains.com>`_.

    _`IDE`
        See `integrated development environment`_.

    _`integrated development environment`
        An integrated development environment (or IDE) is a sophisticated
        tool for facilitating the creation of a computer program and
        managing many aspects of writing, running, testing, documenting,
        deploying, cross-referencing and refactoring that program.

    _`Django`
        A popular Python web framework that allows for rapid development of
        web pages with minimal "boilerplate" code.  See the `Django web site
        <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ for more information.

    _`word queue`
        A repository of potential words to meet the requirements of the
        latest answer_ search.  The words are retrieved one at a time from
        the queue in the same order as they were found.

    .. _daily quest:
    daily quest
        Each day a set of three :puzzle:s of varying sizes are offered.
        Solving a daily quest gets you more points and more spin_\ s.  It is
        not necessary to solve daily quests to continue solving the main
        puzzles.

    _`spin`
        On the upper right side of the screen there is a multicolored beach
        ball with a number and a plus sign after it.  If the number is
        greater than zero, you can touch it to bring up a dialog box that
        lets you "spin" for more points.
