Usage:
- Open file, put the cursor inside of PlantUML code to render it
- PlantUML code must be inside @startuml and @enduml tags to be rendered
- A new file can be created from template (File | New | select e.g. 'UML Sequence' template)
- PlantUML code can be placed anywhere, '*' are ignored for usage in Java comments
- To render other than sequence diagram types, install Graphviz and set path to it
- About screen tests Graphviz installation
- Image cache size can be tuned in the settings, if you have not enough heap
- You can use intention to reverse arrows (Alt+Enter)
- Cursor on top of @startuml allows to use following intentions:
  - disable syntax check
  - enable partial rendering - renders each page on it's own, useful for big sequence diagram files
- Performance tips:
  - disable automatic rendering and use Update (Alt+D) or Reload (Alt+F) buttons
  - do not put @newpage into included files (it prohibits incremental rendering)
  - try to enable partial rendering
  - disable syntax checking
