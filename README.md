# WordTrekSolver

## Purpose
Tool to help solve the WorkTrek Puzzle by PlaySimple Games Pte Ltd., 
available for iOS or Android. Unlike the 
web sites with answers, this tool requires one to enter the letters for 
each puzzle as well as indicate the length of each answer expected.

For technical details see the [techical details file](Technical Details.md).

## Usage
See [Build Instructions](Build Instructions) below.

## Build Instructions
**This tool does not work in its present form!**

This tool worked several years ago but has not been used since.  The logic 
is complete but the frameworks have not (yet) been brought up to date so 
that it runs again -- hence the "interim" branch.  At a later date it will 
be modified to use current libraries.

## Releases
This code has not been packaged for a release (yet).
